                <h2>Overview</h2>
            </header>
            <p>In this tutorial, you will learn how to write content for tutorials.ubuntu.com and reach a wide audience of both
                beginner Linux users and advanced users such as developers and system administrators.</p>
            <p>We will start by looking at general guidelines, the structure of a tutorial and go through the publication and
                review process.</p>

            <h3>What you'll learn</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>How to create and structure a tutorial from a single Markdown file</li>
                <li>How to use the additional Markdown features specific to the engine</li>
                <li>How to render it locally to see what your readers will see</li>
                <li>How to get it ready for review by the Ubuntu Docs team</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>What you'll need</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>A computer running Ubuntu 16.04 or above</li>
                <li>The git command-line client (that you can install by running sudo apt install git)</li>
                <li>Docker to run the website locally</li>
                <li>A GitHub account, for the publication and review process</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Depending on the topic and your level of experience, writing a tutorial can be a very easy task, but following
                these guidelines is important to keep the whole set of published tutorials consistent. Let's get started!</p>
        </section>

        <!--Next Main Section Begins-->

        <section class="main-section" id="General_guidelines">
            <header>
                <h2>General Guidelines</h2>
            </header>
            <h3>Mission of tutorials </h3>
            <p>Tutorials are step by step guides aimed at a very diverse audience. To provide a good learning experience, a
                consistent and didactic approach is key.

            </p>
            <p>A good tutorial should:

            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>be focused on one topic or a very small group of related topics. Keep it simple and on point as people who
                    want to learn multiple subjects will take multiple tutorials.
                </li>
                <li>produce a tangible result. The topic is demonstrated with a small practical project and not only a theoretical
                    or "hello world" example. The tutorial reader will come out of it with a working example on their environment.
                </li>
                <li>be short. An estimated 60 minutes for a tutorial is an absolute maximum. Most tutorials should be in the
                    range of 15 - 30 minutes.
                </li>
                <li>be divided in short steps. Each step is practical and results in user-visible progress.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Tone</h3>
            <p>The tone of your tutorial should be friendly. Try to make the reader feel that they're building and learning
                something together with you.

            </p>
            <p>All tutorials should have the same tone, regardless of the topic. This is why you should complete one or two
                of the existing tutorials before writing your first one.

            </p>
            <p>In short, this isn't a teacher/student paradigm, but rather friends sharing some time together. Thus,
                <strong>"we"</strong> should be used as much as possible, like
                <strong>"we have just seen", "we now understand that...".</strong> However,
                <strong>"you"</strong> can be used for demonstrating things in the user's context, like:
                <strong>"edit your file", "your directory should look like this", "on your system",</strong>etc.

            </p>
            <p>And now, let's see the first required step!

                <h2>Metadata and Structure</h2>
            </header>
            <p>Each tutorial is built using a single Markdown file.</p>
            <p>This file starts with a set of metadata in Front matter format to be consumed by the tutorials engine. For example,
                at the top of the source file of this guidelines tutorial, you will find:

            <p>Let's have a look at each field:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>id: the identifier of the tutorial to be used in the URL. Keep it short but clear.</li>

                <li>difficulty: the scale spans from 1 to 5. Beginners without previous knowledge of the given topic should be

                <h2>Introducing your content
                </h2>
            </header>
            <p>First impressions matter and the first page of your tutorial should be welcoming and informative. On tutorials.ubuntu.com,
                an "Overview" page should be the first step of every tutorial.</p>
            <p>The overview contains at least three small parts:

            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>a summary

            <h3>The summary
            </h3>
            <p>The first paragraph or parapgraphs of the overview is a summary of the tutorial's objectives, its purpose and
                why the reader should go through it. An image can be included, as well as external links.

            </p>

                ## Overview
                <br> Duration: 1:00
                <br> Turning your website into a desktop integrated app is a relatively simple thing to do, but distributing
                it as such and making it noticeable in app stores is another story.
                <br> This tutorial will show you how to leverage Electron and snaps to create a website-based desktop app from
                scratch and publish it on a multi-million user store shared between many Linux distributions.
                <br> For this tutorial, the website we are going to package is an HTML5 game called [Castle Arena](http://castlearena.io).

            </code>
            <h3>The "What you'll learn" section
            </h3>
            <p>This section includes the list of topics covered by your tutorial. It's a way to align readers expectations with
                the content they are going to read. Topics are presented as bullet points.

            </p>
            <h4>Example</h4>
            <code>
                ### What you'll learn
                <br> - How to create a website-based desktop app using Electron
                <br> - How to turn it into a snap package
                <br> - How to test it and share it with the world
            </code>
            <h3>The "What you'll need" section
            </h3>
            <p>This is the list of prerequisites the reader needs to meet before starting the tutorial. If there is a need for
                specific hardware, software or user accounts, this is the right place to talk about it. If there is a need
                for specific technical knowledge to go through your tutorial, use this section as an opportunity to link
                to documentation and other tutorials.

            </p>
            <h4>Example</h4>
            <code>### What you'll need
                <br> - Ubuntu Desktop 16.04 or above
                <br> - Some basic command-line knowledge</code>
            <h3>Optionally: a survey widget
            </h3>
            <p>You can gather some insights on who your readers are by adding a survey widget. Using this widget is not a requirement,
                but it helps gathering audience statistics and can help making tutorials better as a whole.

            </p>
            <p>To create this widget, you need to use the following syntax:

            </p>
            <code>
                Survey
                <br> : How will you use this tutorial?
                <br> - Only read through it
                <br> - Read it and complete the exercises
                <br> : What is your current level of experience?
                <br> - Novice
                <br> - Intermediate
                <br> - Proficient
                <br>
            </code>
            <p>Note that Google Analytics is used as the survey backend.

            </p>
            <p>When you are done with your friendly and informative introduction, you can start adding more steps (remember,
                second level titles are used to declare the start of a step) and build your tutorial story.</p>
            <p>To do so, we will now go through some content recommendations.
